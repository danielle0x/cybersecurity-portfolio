# **Cybersecurity Portfolio**



This repository demonstrates my hands-on experience in cybersecurity, covering defensive, offensive, forensic, and system/network security. All projects and exercises are organised into five categories, showcasing real-world skills and practical knowledge.



## **Categories**



### **1. Defensive Security \& Incident Response**



* [EDR Incident Analysis](./defensive-security-incident-response/edr-incident-analysis) – Simulated endpoint detection and response investigations.



* [Splunk Log Analysis](./defensive-security-incident-response/splunk-log-analysis) – Log monitoring and threat detection.



* [Real Incidents Reports (Anonymised)](./defensive-security-incident-response/real-incidents-reports-anonymised) – Professionally documented real security incidents using Bitdefender GravityZone for data collection.



 ### **2. Digital Forensics**



* [Digital Forensics Acquisition](./digital-forensics/digital-forensics-acquisition) – Secure collection and preservation of digital evidence using FTK.



### **3. Offensive Security \& Reconnaissance**



* [Active \& Passive Reconnaissance](./offensive-security-reconnaissance/active-passive-reconnaissance) – Gathering target information.



* [Buffer Overflow Exploitation](./offensive-security-reconnaissance/buffer-overflow-exploitation) – Testing memory vulnerabilities with custom vulnerable script.



* [Credential Harvesting](./offensive-security-reconnaissance/credential-harvesting) – Simulated attack to understand credential-based risks using SET(Social Engineering Toolkit).



* [Nmap Scanning Techniques](./offensive-security-reconnaissance/nmap-scanning-techniques) – Network discovery and service enumeration.



### **4. Vulnerability Management**



* [Vulnerability Assessments (Anonymised)](./vulnerability-managment/vulnerability-assessments-anonymised/) –  Professionally conducted vulnerability assessments.



### **5. System \& Network Security**



* [Linux Privilege Escalation](./system-network-security/linux-privilege-escalation) – Kernel privilege escalation analysis.



* [SSH Secure Configuration](./system-network-security/ssh-secure-configuration) – SSH hardening.



* [WiFi Security Evaluation](./system-network-security/wifi-security-evaluation) – Assessing WiFi authentication security.
