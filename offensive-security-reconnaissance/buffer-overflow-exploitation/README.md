# **Buffer Overflow Exploit Project**



### **Descpription**

This project demonstrates a classic buffer overflow exploit on a vulnerable C program. The goal is to show understanding of **memory corruption, stack layout** and **exploitation techniques** using **GCC, GDB,** manual payload construction, and corresponding **secure coding mitigations**.

### **The project includes:**

* [The vulnerable C source file](./vulnerable-script.c)
* Compilation with disabled security mechanisms
* Analysis of the binary using GDB
* Crafting a payload to redirect execution to a malicious function
* Secure coding remediations

### **Exploitation Process**


**1\. Compilation (Disabling Protections)**



To make the binary exploitable, I compiled it with GCC removing **stack protection**, enabling an **executable stack** and disabling **PIE** for fixed addresses:



`gcc -fno-stack-protector -z execstack -no-pie VulnerableScript.c -o VulnerableScript`



**2\. Locating the Malicious Function**



The binary was analysed using GDB to locate the address of the malicious function to redirect execution to (e.g., **jackpot()**):



`gdb vulnerable-script`





To list function addresses:



`info functions`



The address of jackpot() was identified and used to overwrite the saved return address on the stack.



**3\. Crafting the Overflow Payload**



The payload consists of:



* **Filler bytes** to overflow the buffer (AAAAABBBBBBBB)



* **Overwrite of the saved return address** with the jackpot()



Example payload:



`run $(printf "AAAAABBBBBBBB\\xA2\\x11\\x40\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00")`



If the exploit succeeds, **execution flow is redirected** and the program prints:

`You won!`

### **Secure Coding Remediation**



To prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities like the one demonstrated:



* Use safer string-handling functions (**fgets(), strncpy()**) instead of unsafe functions



* Validate **input size** before copying data into fixed‑size buffers.



* Compile with **security protections enabled** (stack protector, PIE, non-executable stack).



* Avoid very small fixed-size buffers and allocate memory safely.



* Perform basic code reviews to detect unsafe functions.
