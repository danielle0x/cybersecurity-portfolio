### **3\. Description:**



On September 29, 2025 at 11:32, on the machine \[endpoint-name] at the \[site-name] of \[company-name], a malicious executable disguised as a WinRAR installer (winrar-64-6.22-installer\_w-bqwu1.exe) was detected and flagged as potentially malicious. The file was manually downloaded and executed by the user in the Downloads folder. However, the action was promptly blocked by Bitdefender and the file was quarantined to prevent further execution.

---

### **4\. Investigation Findings (Sandbox Analysis)**

The following behaviors were observed during dynamic analysis in a controlled Sandbox environment. Due to the proactive block on the endpoint, these activities did not occur on the live host.

● **Incident Classification:** True Positive (TP)

● **Confidence Level:** High

### **4.1. Indicators of Compromise (IoC) & Evidence**


● **File Name:** winrar-64-6.22-installer_w-bqwu1.exe

● **SHA-256:** acb5febfc2675d5c590ee49b7af3b44cc2c21b7553ccfb6755fd9c505320dd79

● **C2 Infrastructure (Potential):** d1fqc34cbyecmx.cloudfront.net

● **Resolved IPs:** 13.227.211.220, 13.227.211.29, 13.227.211.226, 13.227.211.125

● **VirusTotal Analysis:** [View Report](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/acb5febfc2675d5c590ee49b7af3b44cc2c21b7553ccfb6755fd9c505320dd79/details)

● **Detection Ratio:** 34/72 (Adware/Trojan)

● [Virus total screenshot here](./virustotal-screenshot.png): VirusTotal scan results confirming the malicious reputation of the executable

### **4.2. Behavioral Analysis (Indicators of Attack - IoA)**

The sandbox execution revealed multi-stage malware characteristics:

● **Discovery:** The process attempted to read the MachineGUID to unique identify the victim's system (Fingerprinting).

● **Persistence Control:** Creation of Mutex H\{b38502e4-3a51-40b4-9a38-1f708fae605e}I to manage process instances.

● **Network Call-out:** Attempted communication with CloudFront URLs (/o and /zbd) likely intended for secondary payload retrieval.

● **Evasion:** Automatic deletion of temporary components in %TEMP% to hinder forensic analysis.


### **4.3 MITRE Techniques**

● [T1047](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047/) – WMI Execution



● [T1055.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/002/) – Process Injection



● [T1082](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1082/) – System Information Discovery

### **4.4. Analyst Assessment**

The investigation confirms a high-risk attempt to deploy a multi-stage Trojan, disguised as a legitimate WinRAR installer to deceive the user (Social Engineering).

While the sandbox analysis revealed critical behaviors, such as system fingerprinting and C2 callbacks, these activities were restricted to the isolated environment. Thanks to the proactive block by Bitdefender's EDR at the Execution stage, the malicious payload was never able to initialize on the production host. Consequently, there is no evidence of persistence or data exfiltration. The threat was successfully neutralized before it could move further along the Cyber Kill Chain.

---

### **5 Response**



The execution of the suspicious file was **blocked**, the file was **quarantined.** and its hash was added to the Bitdefender **blocklist** to prevent execution across all managed endpoints. Finally, the suspicious executable was permanently removed from the endpoint.

A full antivirus scan was also performed on the endpoint to ensure no further threats were present.

---

### **6. Recommended Actions**



● **Network Defense:** Block d1fqc34cbyecmx.cloudfront.net on proxy/firewall to prevent future hits.

● **Identity Protection:** Force a password reset for the user (standard procedure after manual execution of suspicious files).

● **Evidence Collection:** Copy the quarantined file hash and collect Event Logs for forensic history.

● **Monitoring:** Keep the host under "High Sensitivity" monitoring in Bitdefender for 24h to ensure no secondary processes emerge.

● **Contingency:** Host isolation and reimaging should be considered only if subsequent scans or logs show signs of successful infection.

### **7. Ticket Metadata**


● **Ticket Priority:** 51/100 – Medium 

● **Status:** Resolved
