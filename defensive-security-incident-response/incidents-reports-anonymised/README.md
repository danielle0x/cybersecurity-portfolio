# **Incident Reports – Bitdefender GravityZone**

### **Decription**

These reports are examples of **real incidents** I have analysed and documented using **Bitdefender GravityZone (EDR)** for telemetry collection and investigation.

To ensure privacy and compliance, all sensitive information (company names, specific usernames, private endpoint identifiers, and internal IPs) has been **strictly anonymised.**

### **Incident Cases**

* [Incident 1 – Suspicious Malware Execution](./incident-malware-report-393/README.md)
* [Incident 2 – Phishing Domain Detection](./incident-phishing-report-28/README.md)

### **Purpose** 

These reports demonstrate my core skills in security operations:

* **EDR Operations:** Practical use of Bitdefender GravityZone to triage alerts, analyse process trees, confirm automated blocks and perform manual remediation (quarantine, IoC blocking, file deletion).

* **Threat Investigation:** Using VirusTotal and Sandbox reports to identify malicious domains and Trojan behaviors (C2 calls, fingerprinting).

* **Incident Correlation:** Identifying patterns, such as recurring phishing attempts across multiple endpoints.

* **Response & Reporting:** Delivering professional documentation with actionable remediation steps (host isolation, network policy updates, credential hardening).
