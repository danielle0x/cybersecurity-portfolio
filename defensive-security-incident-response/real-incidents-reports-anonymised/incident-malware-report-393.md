### **3\. Description:**



On September 29, 2025 at 11:32, on the machine \[endpoint-name] at the \[site-name] of \[company-name], an executable named winrar-64-6.22-installer\_w-bqwu1.exe was detected and flagged as potentially malicious.



The file was manually downloaded and executed by the user in the Downloads folder. However, the action was promptly blocked by Bitdefender and the file was quarantined to prevent further execution.



Sandbox analysis revealed that the executable extracted a temporary component in %TEMP% (winrar-64-6.22-installer\_w-bqwu1.tmp) that performed the following suspicious activities:



* Reading the MachineGUID



* Creating a mutex



* Communicating with a CloudFront domain (potential Command \& Control)



* Deleting temporary files



The observed behaviour is consistent with an early-stage multi-stage malware, potentially capable of downloading additional payloads or receiving remote commands.

### **5. Recommended Actions**



* Isolate DESKTOP-CEO52O5 from the network.



* Copy and calculate hashes of the suspicious files to \\\\forensics\\evidence\\DESKTOP-CEO52O5.



* Perform a memory dump (if possible) and collect Event Logs.



* Block d1fqc34cbyecmx.cloudfront.net on proxy/firewall.



* Force a password reset for the account used on the machine.



* Consider reimaging or removal based on the scan results.
