# **EDR Incident Analysis**



### **Overview**



This repository documents my analysis of simulated EDR alerts in a controlled environment. The goal is to demonstrate practical skills in alert triage, incident assessment, and behavioural evaluation.

### **Contents**



Each incident includes:

* **Alert Summary** – key information from the alert  
* **Observed Behaviour** – relevant system or process activity  
* **Assessment** – evaluation of whether the alert represents suspicious or benign behaviour  
* **Evidence** – screenshot of the process trees

### **Purpose**



The project demonstrates my ability to:

* Analyse alerts in a structured and methodical way  
* Evaluate potential security incidents and unusual behaviours  
* Document findings clearly and professionally
